# MapVisitedCountries

MapVisitedCountries is a tool that generates a map and a markdown list of the countries you have visited just by editing a json file.

In the json file you can change the status of a country to true if you have visited such country, and enter by hand the coordinates in the svg map (scale is 100x100)

Pending improvements

- Transform real coordinates (latitude and longitude) to map coordinates through mercator's projection
